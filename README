HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) Timer App

This project uses python and kivy to build an Android app.

Inspired and based on http://1.log.brandonthomson.com/2009/06/python-based-hiit-workout-timer.html but refactored so much that none of the original code exists!

Using https://github.com/brousch/saythis-kivy-intro-app as a base for the Text to Speach.

Only tested on Android, but should work on iOS and other platforms supported by Kivy.
