HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) Timer App

This project uses python and kivy to build an Android app.

Inspired and based on http://1.log.brandonthomson.com/2009/06/python-based-hiit-workout-timer.html but refactored so much that none of the original code exists!

Using https://github.com/brousch/saythis-kivy-intro-app as a base for the Text to Speach.

Icon taken from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Apps-preferences-desktop-accessibility-icon.html

Only very basic at the moment, but does what I need.

Only tested on Android but should work on iOS and other platforms supported by Kivy, but you'll have to build your own (see kivy docs)

Just want to download the .apk?
