HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) Timer App
=================================================

Set the warm up time, number of rounds, work and rest times.  Text to speech countdown “3,2,1” as each work or rest period ends. Defaults to the Tabata settings. Stores a history of your settings for easy selection. Only very basic at the moment, but does what I need.

This project is coded in Python and uses Kivy to build an Android (or iOS) app.

Inspired by and based on http://1.log.brandonthomson.com/2009/06/python-based-hiit-workout-timer.html but re-factored so much that none of the original code exists!

Using https://github.com/brousch/saythis-kivy-intro-app as a base for the Text to Speech.

Using icon from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Apps-preferences-desktop-accessibility-icon.html

Only tested on Android but should work on iOS and other platforms supported by Kivy, but you'll have to package your own:
