HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) Timer App

Set the warmup time, number of rounds, work and rest times.  Test to speech countdown 3,2,1 as each work ar rest round ends. Defaults to the Tabata settings. Stores a history of your settings for easy load. Only very basic at the moment, but does what I need.

This project uses python and kivy to build an Android app.

Inspired and based on http://1.log.brandonthomson.com/2009/06/python-based-hiit-workout-timer.html but refactored so much that none of the original code exists!

Using https://github.com/brousch/saythis-kivy-intro-app as a base for the Text to Speach.

Only tested on Android but should work on iOS and other platforms supported by Kivy, but you'll have to build your own (see kivy docs)
